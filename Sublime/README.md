###Install

####Windows
Place files in 
  ~\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User

####Other OS
I'm not sure yet.

###Configuration changes
View the __Default (Windows).sublime-keymap__ file for a description of the keymap changes.  It is commented where applicable and pretty self-explanitory.  

The __Preferences.sublime-settings__ is pretty basic right now.  Take a look.
